    <h1>Sea level rise and coastal erosion</h1>   
    <hr>
    <p>Sea level rise, driven by melting glaciers and thermal expansion of seawater due to global warming, is causing severe coastal erosion worldwide. As ocean levels increase, shorelines are being swallowed, threatening ecosystems, infrastructure, and human settlements.</p>

    <p>Coastal erosion occurs when waves, storms, and rising waters wear away land, leading to the loss of beaches, cliffs, and wetlands. Low-lying areas, such as small island nations and delta regions, are particularly vulnerable. Cities like Miami, Mumbai, and Jakarta face frequent flooding, property damage, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies.</p>

    <p>The consequences are far-reaching. Coastal habitats, including mangroves and coral reefs, are destroyed, reducing biodiversity and natural storm barriers. Economies suffer as tourism, fisheries, and real estate decline. Millions of people may become climate refugees, forced to relocate as their homes become uninhabitable.</p>

    <p>To combat this crisis, governments must implement adaptive measures such as seawalls, beach nourishment, and mangrove restoration. However, long-term solutions require reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow global warming. Sustainable urban planning and international cooperation are essential to protect coastal communities. Without urgent action, sea level rise and erosion will continue to endanger lives and livelihoods worldwide.</p>
