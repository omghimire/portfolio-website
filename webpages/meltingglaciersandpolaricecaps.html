    <h1>Melting glaciers and polar ice caps</h1>
    <p>The melting of glaciers and polar ice caps is one of the most alarming consequences of climate change. Rising global temperatures, caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, are accelerating ice melt in Antarctica, Greenland, and mountain glaciers worldwide. This phenomenon has severe environmental, ecological, and societal impacts.</p>

    <p>As ice sheets and glaciers melt, sea levels rise, threatening coastal communities with flooding, erosion, and habitat loss. Scientists estimate that if current trends continue, sea levels could rise by several feet by the end of the century, displacing millions of people. Additionally, melting ice disrupts ocean currents, leading to extreme weather patterns and affecting marine ecosystems.</p>

    <p>The loss of polar ice also reduces the Earth’s albedo effect—the ability to reflect sunlight. Darker ocean waters absorb more heat, further accelerating global warming in a dangerous feedback loop. Moreover, shrinking glaciers endanger freshwater supplies for millions who rely on glacial runoff for drinking and agriculture.</p>

    <p>Urgent action is needed to reduce carbon emissions, transition to renewable energy, and protect vulnerable regions. International cooperation and sustainable policies are essential to mitigate the effects of melting ice and preserve our planet for future generations. The time to act is now before irreversible damage occurs.</p>
