    <h1>Ocean Acidification</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Ocean acidification is a critical environmental issue caused by the excessive absorption of carbon dioxide (CO₂) by seawater. When CO₂ dissolves in the ocean, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of seawater, making it more acidic. Since the Industrial Revolution, the ocean’s acidity has increased by 30%, posing severe risks to marine ecosystems.</p>

    <p>The primary victims of acidification are shell-forming organisms like corals, mollusks, and plankton. Acidic water reduces the availability of carbonate ions, which are essential for building calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. As a result, coral reefs—biodiversity hotspots—are weakening, and many shellfish species struggle to survive. This disruption affects the entire marine food web, including fish populations that millions of people rely on for food and income.</p>

    <p>Additionally, ocean acidification worsens climate change impacts. Healthy oceans absorb CO₂, but as acidification progresses, their capacity to act as carbon sinks diminishes, accelerating global warming.</p>

    <p>Addressing this issue requires reducing CO₂ emissions through sustainable practices, protecting marine habitats, and supporting research on acidification-resistant species. Immediate action is necessary to safeguard marine life and maintain the ocean’s vital role in Earth’s ecosystem.</p>
