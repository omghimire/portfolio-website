    <h1>Carbon Footprint & Net-Zero Goals</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by an individual, organization, or product, expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents. As climate change accelerates, reducing our carbon footprint has become crucial to limit global warming.</p>

    <p>Concept of net-zero emissions—balancing emitted greenhouse gases with their removal from the atmosphere—has emerged as a key global target. Countries and corporations are committing to net-zero goals, aiming to achieve this balance by mid-century. Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture technologies are essential strategies to reach these targets.</p>

    <p>Individuals can reduce their carbon footprint by adopting sustainable practices, such as using public transport, consuming less meat, and minimizing waste. Businesses must transition to clean energy, improve supply chain sustainability, and invest in green innovations. Governments play a vital role by enforcing carbon pricing, promoting renewable energy policies, and supporting climate resilience programs.</p>

    <p>However, achieving net-zero requires global cooperation and urgent action. Delayed efforts risk worsening climate impacts, including extreme weather, food insecurity, and ecosystem collapse. By embracing sustainability and innovation, humanity can curb emissions, protect the planet, and secure a livable future for generations to come. The time to act is now—every reduction in our carbon footprint brings us closer to a net-zero world.</p>
