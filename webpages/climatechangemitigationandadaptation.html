    <h1>Climate change mitigation and adaptation</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Climate change poses one of the greatest challenges of our time, requiring both mitigation (reducing causes) and adaptation (adjusting to impacts) to protect communities and ecosystems.</p>

    <p>Mitigation focuses on cutting greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, reforestation, and sustainable agriculture. Transitioning from fossil fuels to solar, wind, and hydropower is essential to limit global warming. Carbon pricing, green technologies, and stricter environmental policies can accelerate progress toward net-zero emissions.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, adaptation helps societies cope with unavoidable climate effects, such as rising seas, extreme weather, and food insecurity. Building flood-resistant infrastructure, restoring wetlands as natural buffers, and developing drought-resistant crops are key strategies. Early warning systems and climate-smart urban planning can save lives in vulnerable regions.</p>

    <p>While mitigation tackles the root cause, adaptation addresses immediate risks—both are necessary for resilience. Developed nations must support developing countries with funding and technology to implement these measures. Public awareness and policy action are crucial to drive change.</p>

    <p>The fight against climate change demands global cooperation. By combining mitigation and adaptation, we can reduce future harm while safeguarding lives and ecosystems today. The time for decisive action is now—delay will only increase the cost and severity of climate impacts.</p>
