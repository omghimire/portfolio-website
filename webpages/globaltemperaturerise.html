    <h1>Global Temperature Rise & Extreme Weather Events</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The rise in global temperatures, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has led to a significant increase in extreme weather events worldwide. According to climate scientists, the Earth's average temperature has increased by over 1Â°C since the pre-industrial era, resulting in more frequent and intense heatwaves, storms, floods, and droughts.</p>

    <p>One of the most visible effects of global warming is the surge in heatwaves, which have become longer and more severe. Countries like India, Australia, and parts of Europe have recorded record-breaking temperatures, leading to health crises and wildfires. Additionally, rising ocean temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes and cyclones, causing devastating damage to coastal regions.</p>

    <p>Extreme rainfall and flooding have also intensified due to warmer air holding more moisture. Conversely, some regions face prolonged droughts, threatening agriculture and water supplies. The 2023 wildfires in Canada and the deadly floods in Pakistan demonstrate how climate change amplifies natural disasters.</p>

    <p>If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, these extreme weather events will worsen, endangering lives, economies, and ecosystems. Urgent global action, including transitioning to renewable energy and adopting sustainable practices, is essential to mitigate this crisis and protect future generations.</p>
